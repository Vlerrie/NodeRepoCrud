## A Basic Note Taking App

### Setup

- After cloning the git repo please create a local mongo database and collection and call the collection "Notes"
- Open the .env file that has been included in the repo for convenience.
- Only change the DB\_\* variables to match the Mongo db and collection that was created.
- Open a command line in the root directory of the project and run the following command: "npm start"
- Open a second command line in the root/react-app directory and run the "npm start" command there too.
- Go to localhost:3000 in the browser to view the end result.
